Introduction
------------

This document outlines the structure and format of the CSV file used in our project. The CSV file includes various headers related to medical imaging data, specifically tailored to our needs.

File Structure
--------------

The CSV file contains the following columns:

.. list-table:: CSV Header Descriptions
