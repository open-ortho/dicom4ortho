Log Summary:	 Add Dental Acquisition Attributes into VL IOD 
Name of Standard
PS3.3, PS3.6, PS3.16 2025a
Rationale for Change:
The Rationale for Correction:
Dentistry needs to make use of Acquisition Context attributes for clinical and forensic use cases. 
The Visible Light Photography IOD includes the “Acquisition Context Module” to describe conditions present during data acquisition. Rather than develop a new module, a new context group provides the required standard attributes. Other attributes may be vendor-specific; therefore, it may not be possible to define the commonly used values. However, being able to convey those in a coded way in the Acquisition Context Sequence appears to be much more favorable and informative to the end-user, compared to the use of private tags.
A prospective ADA Standard (ADA-1107), with the potential to evolve into an IHE Profile (DENT-OIP), meticulously describes how to use DICOM for orthodontic photographs, and has been used as a source for this Correction Package. Regular nightly builds can be accessed at the following link: https://open-ortho.org/dent-oip/nightly/.
An operational instantiation of this standard is underway, facilitated by the open-ortho project. For more information, visit: https://github.com/open-ortho/dicom4ortho.

Note
    1. Laterality (0020,0060) is a Series level Attribute and must be the same for all Images in the Series, hence it must be absent if Image Laterality (0020,0062) has different values for Images in the same Series.

Note
Interpretation and representation of RGB images rely on the assumption that the red channel really contains the red wavelength range of illumination light, the blue channel the blue wavelength range, etc. Some modalities use the RGB Photometric Interpretation as a container representing 3 channels of any illumination wavelength.
Shall have the same number of Items as the value of Samples per Pixel (0028,0002). The channels shall be described in the order in which the channels are encoded.
>Include Table 8.8-1 “Code Sequence Macro Attributes”
