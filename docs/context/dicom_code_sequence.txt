8 Encoding of Coded Entry Data
The primary method of incorporating coded entry data in DICOM IODs is the Code Sequence Attribute. These attributes are encoded as a Sequence of Items, typically including "Code Sequence" in their name, and encode terms using codes from Coding Schemes.

Each item in a Code Sequence Attribute contains:

Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102)

Code Value (0008,0100) (or Long Code Value (0008,0119) or URN Code Value (0008,0120))

Code Meaning (0008,0104)

Optional and conditional attributes may also be present.

The range of codes for a Code Sequence Attribute can be suggested or constrained by a Context Group.

A Baseline Context Group lists suggested codes that are not required.

A Defined Context Group lists codes that shall be used if the term is used.

Context Groups are defined in a Mapping Resource (e.g., DICOM Content Mapping Resource (DCMR) in PS3.16). They consist of lists of contextually related coded concepts, unique by their Code Value (or Long/URN Code Value) and Coding Scheme Designator. Context Groups can be extensible.

Context Identifiers (CID) (0008,010F) formally specify the context of use.

8.1 Code Value
Code Value (0008,0100): An identifier unambiguous within its Coding Scheme.

Shall be present if the code value length is â‰¤ 16 characters and is not a URN or URL.

Long Code Value (0008,0119): Used for codes exceeding 16 characters and not a URN/URL. If present, Code Value (0008,0100) shall not be present.

URN Code Value (0008,0120): Used for codes represented using URN or URL notation. If present, Code Value (0008,0100) shall not be present.

8.2 Coding Scheme Designator and Coding Scheme Version
Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102): Identifies the Coding Scheme. Standard designators are listed in PS3.16.

Shall be present if Code Value (0008,0100) or Long Code Value (0008,0119) is present.

Coding Scheme Version (0008,0103): May identify the version if necessary to resolve ambiguity.

Required if Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102) is present and insufficient to identify the Code Value unambiguously.

Shall not be present if Coding Scheme Designator (0008,0102) is absent.

8.3 Code Meaning
Code Meaning (0008,0104): Text conveying the meaning of the Coded Entry.

Shall never be used as a key, index, or decision value.

Values should be from the Coding Scheme or its translations, not arbitrary free text.

8.4 Mapping Resource
Mapping Resource (0008,0105): Denotes the message/terminology Mapping Resource that specifies the Context Group.

Defined Terms: DCMR (DICOM Content Mapping Resource), SDM (SNOMED DICOM Microglossary - Retired).

Required if Context Identifier (0008,010F) is present.

Mapping Resource UID (0008,0118): Unique identifier for the Mapping Resource.

Mapping Resource Name (0008,0122): Name of the Mapping Resource.

8.5 Context Group Version
Context Group Version (0008,0106): Conveys the version of the Context Group identified by Context Identifier (0008,010F).

Required if Context Identifier (0008,010F) is present.

8.6 Context Identifier and Context UID
Context Identifier (0008,010F): Identifies the Context Group from which Code Values/Meanings were selected or extended.

For PS3.16 defined Context Groups, the Value shall be the Context Group Identifier as a string of digits without leading zeros.

Context UID (0008,0117): Uniquely identifies the Context Group.

8.7 Context Group Extensions
Context Group Extension Flag (0008,010B): Indicates if the code triplet is from a private extension.

Enumerated Values: Y, N.

Context Group Local Version (0008,0107): An implementation-specific private version DateTime.

Required if Context Group Extension Flag (0008,010B) is "Y".

Context Group Extension Creator UID (0008,010D): Identifies the creator of the extension.

Required if Context Group Extension Flag (0008,010B) is "Y".
