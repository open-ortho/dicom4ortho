About The Project
=================

The DICOM standard is ready for any developer in the orthodontic
community to implement. However, it can be complicated and implementation can be
time consuming. The DICOM standard is also does not contain an explicit
explanation on orthodntic photographs, allowing the developer too much freedom.

This is why we decided to implement ANSI Standard ADA-1107, which defines
exactly how to use DICOM to encode orthodontic photographs.

We want to create a proof of concept to demonstrate how to properly store
orthodontic visible light images (aka photographs) using DICOM, while ensuring
all codes (necessary to uniquely identify each image type) are in the proper
place.

Hereâ€™s why:

-  Your time should be focused on creating something amazing.
-  Being able to import and export DICOM images to and from your
   orthodontic software will open doors to you and the orthodontic
   provider.
-  No one software will serve all orthodontic providers completely.
   Adding interoperability will allow your product to integrate with
   others, giving additional value to your solution.
