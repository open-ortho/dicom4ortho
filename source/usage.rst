Usage
-----

The DICOM images require a lot of information which is not contained in
a flat PNG or JPEG image. This information would, in a production
environment, usually come from the practice management software, or
photo management software.

The easiest way to feed this information to ``dicom4ortho``\ â€™s CLI is
using a CSV file. You can find an example CSV file
`here <resources/example/input_from.csv>`__

Once installed, if necessary, start the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   pipenv shell

then use dicom4ortho like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dicom4ortho <filename>

Where ``filename`` should be a ``.csv`` file. Passing a single image
file with metadata through arguments is planned for future
implementations.
