``--validate`` option is used. This is just a conveninece wrapper for
debugging, and itâ€™s installation is not necessary for normal operation.

The `dicom3tools <https://www.dclunie.com/dicom3tools.html>`__ can be
installed from compiled binaries, which are available for macOS and
Windows.

Once installed, point ``DICOM3TOOLS_PATH`` in ``defaults.py`` to the
